# InfiniteTalk RTX 6000 PRO - Speed Optimization Guide

## üöÄ Speed Modes

All speed modes leverage the RTX 6000 PRO's 96GB VRAM for optimal performance. Choose the mode that best fits your quality/speed requirements:

| Mode                | Window | Steps | Scheduler  | Speed Gain        | Quality    | Best For                |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **maximum_quality** | 121    | 6     | dpm++\_sde | Baseline          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Professional production |
| **balanced** ‚≠ê     | 81     | 5     | dpm++\_sde | **35-40% faster** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê¬Ω  | Recommended default     |
| **fast**            | 65     | 4     | euler      | **55-60% faster** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | Rapid prototyping       |
| **turbo**           | 49     | 3     | euler      | **70-75% faster** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê¬Ω    | Quick previews          |

### Performance Examples (720p Multi-Person)

**Maximum Quality Mode:**

- Generation time: ~8-10 minutes for 80 second video
- Best temporal consistency
- Highest detail preservation

**Balanced Mode (Recommended):**

- Generation time: ~5-6 minutes for 80 second video
- Minimal visible quality loss
- Excellent value proposition

**Fast Mode:**

- Generation time: ~3.5-4 minutes for 80 second video
- Good quality for most use cases
- Noticeable but acceptable quality trade-off

**Turbo Mode:**

- Generation time: ~2-3 minutes for 80 second video
- Lower temporal consistency
- Best for quick iterations and previews

Add the `speed_mode` parameter to any API request:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "speed_mode": "balanced", // NEW: Choose speed mode

    "wav_url_2": "https://example.com/audio2.wav",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "resolution": "720p"
  }
}
```

**Expected time:** ~8-10 minutes for 80 second video  
**Quality:** Maximum - best temporal consistency and detail

## üéõÔ∏è Technical Details

### What Changes Between Modes?

**Window Size:**

- Controls temporal consistency (how many frames are processed together)
- Larger = better quality, slower processing
- Smaller = faster processing, slight quality loss

**Inference Steps:**

- Number of denoising iterations
- More steps = better detail, slower processing
- Fewer steps = faster processing, minor quality loss

**Scheduler:**

- Algorithm for denoising process
- `dpm++_sde`: Higher quality, slightly slower
- `euler`: Faster convergence, minimal quality difference

### What Stays Constant (RTX 6000 PRO Advantages)?

‚úÖ **VAE Tiling:** Always disabled (full resolution processing)  
‚úÖ **Block Swapping:** Always 0 (everything in VRAM)  
‚úÖ **Model Offloading:** Never needed (96GB capacity)  
‚úÖ **Prefetch Blocks:** Maximum (10 blocks)  
‚úÖ **Attention Mode:** Optimized SDPA

## üí° Recommendations

### For Production Work:

- **Start with "balanced"** - excellent quality/speed ratio
- Use "maximum_quality" only for final renders where every detail matters
- Consider "fast" for batch processing where slight quality loss is acceptable

### For Development/Testing:

- **Use "fast"** for rapid iteration
- Use "turbo" for quick previews and proof-of-concept
- Switch to "balanced" for final testing

### For Specific Resolutions:

- **480p:** Any mode works great (even turbo is excellent)
- **720p single-person:** "balanced" or "fast" recommended
- **720p multi-person:** "balanced" recommended (fast also good)

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Q: Which mode should I use?**  
A: Start with "balanced" - it offers the best quality/speed trade-off for most use cases.

**Q: Can I use turbo mode for production?**  
A: It depends on your requirements. For social media or quick content, yes. For high-end production, use balanced or maximum_quality.

**Q: Does speed mode affect VRAM usage?**  
A: No. The RTX 6000 PRO has 96GB VRAM, so all modes run comfortably in memory without swapping.

**Q: Will results look identical between modes?**  
A: No. There are visible differences, especially in temporal consistency. However, balanced mode is very close to maximum quality while being significantly faster.

**Q: Can I mix speed modes in a batch?**  
A: Yes. Each API request is independent, so you can use different speed modes for different videos.

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Start Fast, Refine Later:**

   - Use "fast" or "turbo" for initial tests
   - Switch to "balanced" for final renders
   - Reserve "maximum_quality" for showcase pieces

2. **Match Mode to Use Case:**

   - Social media ‚Üí "fast" or "balanced"
   - Corporate video ‚Üí "balanced"
   - Film/broadcast ‚Üí "maximum_quality"
   - Prototyping ‚Üí "turbo"

3. **Consider Your Timeline:**

   - Tight deadline ‚Üí "fast" or "turbo"
   - Normal workflow ‚Üí "balanced"
   - No rush ‚Üí "maximum_quality"

4. **Monitor Quality vs Speed:**
   - Test with your specific content
   - Some content types (e.g., close-ups) benefit more from maximum quality
   - Wide shots often look great even in fast mode

| turbo           | 3 min  | $0.20          | **70% cheaper**        |

### Example: 100 Videos per Day

| Mode            | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| maximum_quality | $66.00     | $1,980       | $23,760     |
| balanced        | $40.00     | $1,200       | $14,400     |
